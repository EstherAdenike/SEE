# **🎉 Fun Calculator - README** 🎛️  

A simple yet fun calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. Perfect for quick math with a touch of humor! 😊  

---

## **✨ Features**  
✅ **Addition** (`+`) – Adds two numbers like a pro!  
✅ **Subtraction** (`-`) – Keeps the vibes positive (or negative, if needed 😜).  
✅ **Multiplication** (`×`) – Makes numbers grow fast! 💥  
✅ **Division** (`÷`) – Splits numbers (but please, no division by zero—math hates that! 😅).  

---

## **🚀 How to Run**  
1. **Make sure you have Python installed** (Python 3.x recommended).  
2. **Download or copy the script** (`fun_calculator.py`).  
3. **Run it in your terminal/command line:**  
   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
4. **Follow the prompts** – Enter two numbers and watch the magic happen! ✨  

---

## **📝 Example Usage**  
```bash
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 2  

Results of your two numbers:  
Sum: 12.0  
Difference: 8.0  
Product: 20.0  
Quotient: 5.0  
```

## **⚠️ Important Note**  
- **Division by zero will crash the program!** (Python doesn’t like infinite math problems. 😅)  
- For a more robust version, consider adding error handling (future update? 🤔).  

---

## **🛠️ Future Improvements**  
🔹 Add error handling for invalid inputs (like text instead of numbers).  
🔹 Support more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.).  
🔹 Make it a loop so users can keep calculating without rerunning.
